# cs-concept
## A platform to share CS opportunities

Right now this is only a front-end concept, which may be developed further into a production-ready platform later.

## Tag Functionality
The main feature of our concept is the tag feature. The primary interaction with this site will be through the "search box", in which you would type tags that you're interested in (e.g. "scholarship" or "hackathon"), and the feed will filter itself to display the relevant content.

*Please note that currently, versions of Firefox <45 do not support classes, and as such, the tag functionality is broken in those browsers.*
